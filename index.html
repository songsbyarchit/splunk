        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This guide will help you install and integrate Splunk with Webex in three different ways.</p>
        <p>This guide is divided into five detailed sections. Each section provides step-by-step instructions to help you navigate through installation, setup, and integration processes. The first section focuses on installing Splunk on macOS. It explains how to download and set up the software from its official website. The second section covers the setup phase, guiding you through starting Splunk and accessing the web interface.</p>
        <p>The last three sections describe three different integration methods. These include using HTTP Event Collector (HEC), leveraging the API for custom data handling, and creating a modular input by building an app within Splunk. These methods ensure flexibility for different use cases.</p>
